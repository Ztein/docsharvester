Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Project: Documentation Scraper for AI Frameworks
1. Project Overview
1.1 Purpose
Develop a Python-based web scraper that downloads and stores documentation from ModelContextProtocol.io into Markdown files for offline reference. The program should be designed to be easily adaptable for other documentation sites (such as Pydantic AI) to facilitate "vibe coding" in development environments like Cursor or Claude Code.
1.2 Goals

Create a reusable documentation scraper framework
Download complete ModelContextProtocol.io documentation
Convert HTML content to well-formatted Markdown
Maintain link integrity within the saved documents
Organize content in a structured file hierarchy
Enable easy extension to other documentation sources

2. Functional Requirements
2.1 Core Functionality

Website Crawling: Systematically traverse ModelContextProtocol.io to identify all documentation pages
Content Extraction: Parse HTML content and extract meaningful documentation text
Markdown Conversion: Convert HTML content to Markdown while preserving:

Headers and section structure
Code blocks and syntax highlighting
Tables
Lists (ordered and unordered)
Images (with appropriate references)
Links (both internal and external)


File Storage: Save content to disk following the specified naming convention
Configurability: Allow easy reconfiguration for other documentation sites

2.2 File Naming and Organization

Store all files in a "MCP_DOCS" directory
Follow naming pattern: "MCP_[PAGE_NAME].md" (e.g., "MCP_INTRODUCTION.md", "MCP_CORE_ARCHITECTURE.md")
Convert page titles to uppercase with underscores for spaces
Maintain a logical hierarchy that reflects the website's structure

2.3 Link Handling

Preserve all external links as-is
Convert internal links to relative paths that work locally
Handle anchor links appropriately

2.4 Error Handling

Implement robust error handling for network issues
Log all errors and warnings
Skip problematic pages with appropriate logging
Resume capability if the process is interrupted

3. Technical Specifications
3.1 Technology Stack

Python 3.9+
UV package manager for dependency management
Libraries:

BeautifulSoup4 or similar for HTML parsing
Requests or httpx for HTTP requests
Markdown or html2text for HTML to Markdown conversion
PyYAML for configuration



3.2 Architecture

Modular design with separate components for:

Web crawling
Content extraction
Markdown conversion
File I/O operations


Configuration-driven approach for easy adaptation to other sites
Command-line interface with appropriate options

3.3 Performance Requirements

Respect website's robots.txt
Implement rate limiting to avoid overloading the server
Parallel processing where appropriate
Caching mechanism to avoid redundant downloads

4. Implementation Plan
4.1 Project Setup

Initialize Git repository
Set up virtual environment using UV
Create project structure and configuration files
Add initial documentation

4.2 Development Phases

Phase 1: Core Framework

Implement base crawler
Create content extractor
Build Markdown converter
Develop file system handler


Phase 2: ModelContextProtocol.io Implementation

Configure crawler for ModelContextProtocol.io
Test on subset of pages
Implement site-specific parsing rules
Fine-tune Markdown formatting


Phase 3: Extension and Refinement

Add configuration for additional sites (e.g., Pydantic AI)
Improve error handling and recovery
Optimize performance
Add additional features based on testing feedback



4.3 Testing Strategy

Unit tests for each component
Integration tests for end-to-end functionality
Manual validation of output quality
Comparative testing against original source

5. Extension and Reusability
5.1 Configuration Format
Design a YAML configuration format that specifies:

Base URL of documentation site
URL patterns to include/exclude
CSS selectors for content extraction
Output directory structure
File naming conventions
Site-specific parsing rules

5.2 Additional Sites
Document the process for extending to new sites:

Create new configuration file
Specify site-specific selectors
Add any custom parsing hooks if needed
Test and iterate

6. Deliverables

Fully functional Python package
GitHub repository with complete documentation
Configuration file for ModelContextProtocol.io
Sample configuration for at least one additional site (Pydantic AI)
README with usage instructions
Development guide for extending to new sites

7. Success Criteria

All documentation pages from ModelContextProtocol.io successfully downloaded
Content accurately converted to Markdown with preserved formatting
Links work correctly within the local file structure
Code can be easily adapted to work with Pydantic AI documentation
Repository is well-documented and maintainable

8. Future Enhancements

Auto-update feature to refresh documentation
Diff-based updates to only download changed content
Version tracking of documentation
Search functionality within downloaded docs
Integration with AI code assistants' APIs directly
GUI for configuration and monitoring

This PRD provides a comprehensive framework for your documentation scraper project, focusing on both the immediate needs for ModelContextProtocol.io and the flexibility to extend to other documentation sources in the future.
