# STORY-009-3: External Source Link Validation

## Description
As a developer, I need to implement validation for links to external sources to ensure all documentation references to external resources are accessible and valid. This does not include validation of links between documentation pages, as those are handled by the link handler component.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Validation of links to external sources (target: 100%)
- Validation of external API documentation links
- Link validation metrics collection for external sources

- Clear distinction between internal documentation links (which don't need validation) and external source links

## Technical Notes
- Use the simplified architecture components:
  - Web Crawler for external link validation
  - Content Processor for link extraction
  - Monitoring Handler for metrics
- Implement external link validation algorithms
- Create external link validation rules
- Set up metrics collection for external link validation

## Tasks
1. Implement external source link validation
2. Create external API documentation link validation
3. Develop link validation metrics for external sources

## Definition of Done
- External source link validation is implemented
- External API documentation link validation is working
- Link validation metrics are being collected for external sources
- External link validation process is documented

## Story Status
[x] Moved to DOING
[x] Feature branch created
[x] Implementation complete
[x] Tests passing
[ ] Code review completed

## Implementation Notes
- Implemented `ExternalLinkValidator` class with the following features:
  - External link detection and validation
  - API link detection and validation
  - Link validation metrics collection
- Added comprehensive test suite with 100% test coverage
- Added proper error handling and logging
- All tests are passing, including edge cases and error conditions

## Validation Features
- External link validation using HEAD and GET requests
- API link detection for URLs containing '/api/' or starting with 'api.'
- Metrics tracking for:
  - Total external links
  - Valid links
  - Invalid links
  - API links
