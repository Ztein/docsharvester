# STORY-007: Error Handling and Logging

## Description
As a user, I need robust error handling and comprehensive logging to diagnose issues and ensure the scraper can recover from failures.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Implements structured logging with different severity levels
- Catches and handles exceptions appropriately throughout the application
- Provides clear error messages for common issues
- Logs detailed information for debugging
- Allows for configurable log levels
- Provides ability to resume scraping after interruptions or failures
- Implements graceful degradation for non-critical errors

## Technical Notes
- Use Python's logging module for structured logging
- Implement centralized error handling
- Create custom exceptions for application-specific errors
- Consider using a context manager pattern for certain operations
- Implement a tracking system for failed operations to enable resuming

## Tasks
1. Create centralized error handler module
2. Implement structured logging with configurable levels
3. Add custom exceptions for application-specific errors
4. Implement graceful error handling throughout all components
5. Create resumable operations for critical processes
6. Add progress tracking and reporting
7. Implement debug logging for development
8. Create user-friendly error messages
9. Write unit tests for error handling

## Definition of Done
- Error handler successfully catches and processes exceptions
- Logging provides useful information at appropriate levels
- Application can recover from common errors
- Interrupted operations can be resumed
- All unit tests pass
- Error messages are clear and actionable
