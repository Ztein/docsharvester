# STORY-006: Link Handler Implementation

## Description
As a user, I need all links within the documentation to be properly processed so that they work in the local markdown files.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Preserves external links as-is
- Converts internal links to relative paths that work locally
- Handles anchor links appropriately
- Processes image links to reference local images
- Updates internal links to match the naming convention of saved files
- Maintains link integrity throughout the documentation

## Technical Notes
- Implement URL parsing to distinguish between internal and external links
- Create a mapping system to convert URLs to local file paths
- Handle relative links in the source HTML properly
- Consider edge cases like links to PDFs or other non-HTML resources
- Implement special handling for URLs with query parameters or fragments

## Tasks
1. Create link handler module with configurable options
2. Implement URL classification (internal vs external)
3. Add internal link conversion to local paths
4. Create anchor link processing
5. Implement image link handling
6. Add special case handling for non-HTML resources
7. Create link mapping system to match generated filenames
8. Write unit tests for link handling functionality

## Definition of Done
- Link handler correctly identifies and classifies links
- Internal links are properly converted to work locally
- Anchor links function correctly
- Image links reference local resources
- All unit tests pass
- Link integrity is maintained throughout the documentation
