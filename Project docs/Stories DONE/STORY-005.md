# STORY-005: File System Operations

## Description
As a user, I need the converted Markdown content to be saved to disk following a consistent naming convention and directory structure.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Creates necessary directory structure for output
- Generates consistent filenames based on page titles following the specified convention
- Handles special characters and spaces in filenames appropriately
- Avoids filename collisions with a robust strategy
- Creates parent directories as needed
- Handles file operations with appropriate error handling
- Supports different output formats (Markdown as primary, with option for others)

## Technical Notes
- Use pathlib for modern file system operations
- Implement robust sanitization for filenames
- Create a configurable naming convention (UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES, lowercase-with-hyphens, etc.)
- Add checks for existing files to avoid overwriting important content
- Consider adding metadata about the scraping (date, source URL, etc.)

## Tasks
1. Create file system manager module with configurable options
2. Implement directory creation functionality
3. Add filename generation based on page titles and configuration
4. Create file sanitization for special characters and spaces
5. Implement collision detection and resolution
6. Add file writing with appropriate error handling
7. Create metadata storage functionality
8. Write unit tests for file system operations

## Definition of Done
- File system manager successfully creates necessary directories
- Filenames are consistently generated and sanitized
- File collisions are detected and resolved
- Content is correctly written to disk
- All unit tests pass
- File operations handle errors gracefully
