# STORY-003: HTML Content Extraction

## Description
As a user, I need the scraper to extract meaningful documentation content from HTML pages while preserving its structure.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Content extractor can parse HTML using site-specific selectors from configuration
- Extractor successfully identifies and extracts main content areas
- Page titles are correctly extracted
- Content structure (headers, paragraphs, code blocks, etc.) is preserved for conversion
- Unwanted elements (navigation, footers, etc.) are excluded based on configuration

## Technical Notes
- Use BeautifulSoup4 for HTML parsing
- Implement flexible selectors that can be configured per site
- Create a clean data structure that represents the extracted content for further processing
- Handle different HTML structures gracefully
- Handle encoding issues properly

## Tasks
1. Create content extractor module with configurable selectors
2. Implement main content extraction logic
3. Add title extraction functionality
4. Develop element filtering based on ignore_selectors configuration
5. Create data structure for representing extracted content
6. Implement special handling for code blocks, tables, and other complex elements
7. Add metadata extraction (page title, description, etc.)
8. Write unit tests for extraction functionality

## Definition of Done
- Extractor successfully processes test HTML and extracts meaningful content
- All content structure is preserved for conversion
- Unwanted elements are correctly filtered out
- All unit tests pass
- Extractor gracefully handles various HTML formats and encodings
