# STORY-012: Performance Optimization

## Description
As a user, I need the scraper to operate efficiently and handle large documentation sites without excessive resource usage or time.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Implements performance optimizations for CPU, memory, and network usage
- Adds optional parallel processing for faster execution
- Implements caching mechanisms to avoid redundant downloads
- Optimizes HTML parsing and Markdown conversion
- Maintains efficiency with large documentation sites
- Provides performance metrics and monitoring
- Allows for configuration of performance parameters
- Meets or exceeds the following performance benchmarks:
  - Processing speed: >100 pages/minute
  - Memory usage: <500MB for sites up to 1000 pages
  - Network efficiency: <100 concurrent connections
  - Cache hit rate: >80% for repeated runs
  - CPU utilization: <70% on 4-core systems
  - Response time: <200ms per page average

## Technical Notes
- Use the simplified architecture components:
  - Configuration Manager for performance settings
  - Plugin System for site-specific optimizations
  - Web Crawler with connection pooling
  - Content Processor with optimized parsing
  - Storage Manager with efficient caching
  - Monitoring Handler for performance metrics
- Implement connection pooling for HTTP requests (max 100 concurrent connections)
- Use efficient data structures for tracking and processing
- Consider using LRU cache for frequently accessed data (max size: 1000 entries)
- Balance between performance and respectful website crawling
- Implement rate limiting (max 10 requests/second)
- Use memory-mapped files for large datasets

## Tasks
1. Analyze performance bottlenecks in the current implementation
2. Implement HTTP connection pooling in Web Crawler
3. Add caching mechanisms in Storage Manager
4. Optimize memory usage in Content Processor
5. Implement performance metrics in Monitoring Handler
6. Add performance-related configuration options
7. Conduct performance testing and benchmarking
8. Document performance characteristics and configuration
9. Implement parallel processing where applicable
10. Fine-tune resource usage and limits
