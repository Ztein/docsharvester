# STORY-009: Testing and Validation for MCP

## Description
As a user, I need comprehensive testing and validation of the scraper on the full ModelContextProtocol.io documentation to ensure accuracy and completeness.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Conducts full end-to-end testing on ModelContextProtocol.io documentation
- Verifies all pages are discovered and processed
- Validates the accuracy of content extraction (minimum 98% accuracy)
- Ensures link integrity throughout the documentation (100% link validation)
- Verifies correct file naming and organization
- Identifies and addresses any issues or edge cases
- Creates validation report with metrics:
  - Pages processed vs. total pages (target: 100%)
  - Content extraction accuracy (target: >98%)
  - Link validation success rate (target: 100%)
  - Processing time per page (target: <2s)
  - Memory usage during processing (target: <500MB)

## Technical Notes
- Use the simplified architecture components:
  - Configuration Manager for test settings
  - Plugin System for MCP-specific rules
  - Web Crawler for page discovery
  - Content Processor for extraction and conversion
  - Storage Manager for file operations
  - Monitoring Handler for metrics and logging
- Implement metrics collection during scraping
- Create validation scripts to check output quality
- Consider automated comparisons between original and converted content
- Implement logging for validation process
- Create summary report generation

## Tasks
1. Create test plan for full MCP documentation scraping
2. Set up test configuration using simplified architecture
3. Implement metrics collection in Monitoring Handler
4. Develop validation scripts for output quality checks
5. Add comparison tools for original vs. converted content
6. Create report generation for validation results
7. Conduct full end-to-end testing on complete MCP documentation
8. Identify and address any issues or edge cases
9. Generate validation report with metrics
10. Create documentation for testing process

## Definition of Done
- Full MCP documentation is successfully scraped
- All pages are correctly processed with high accuracy (>98%)
- Validation scripts verify output quality with specific metrics
- Link integrity is maintained throughout the documentation (100% success)
- Report shows high success rate (>95%) for all metrics
- Any identified issues are addressed and resolved
- Testing process is documented for future reference
- Performance metrics meet or exceed targets
- All components of the simplified architecture are properly tested
