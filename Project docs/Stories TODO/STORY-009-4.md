# STORY-009-4: Performance Testing Implementation

## Description
As a developer, I need to implement performance testing to ensure the scraper meets efficiency and resource usage requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Processing time validation (target: <2s per page)
- Memory usage monitoring (target: <500MB)
- Performance metrics collection
- Basic performance report generation
- Resource usage optimization recommendations

## Technical Notes
- Use the simplified architecture components:
  - Monitoring Handler for metrics
  - Web Crawler for performance testing
  - Content Processor for efficiency testing
- Implement performance monitoring
- Create resource usage tracking
- Set up performance metrics collection

## Tasks
1. Implement processing time monitoring
2. Create memory usage tracking
3. Develop performance metrics collection
4. Set up performance reporting
5. Create basic performance report
6. Document performance optimization recommendations

## Definition of Done
- Processing time monitoring is implemented
- Memory usage tracking is working
- Performance metrics are being collected
- Basic performance report can be generated
- Performance optimization recommendations are documented
