# STORY-002: Basic Web Crawler Implementation

## Description
As a user, I need the scraper to systematically traverse a documentation website to identify all documentation pages for processing, while respecting website policies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Web crawler can start from a base URL and traverse all pages within the defined patterns
- Crawler respects robots.txt directives
- Rate limiting is implemented to avoid overloading the server
- Crawler handles session management and retries for failed requests
- Crawler identifies and collects URLs based on include/exclude patterns from configuration
- Crawler maintains a queue of pages to visit and tracks visited pages

## Technical Notes
- Use requests or httpx library for HTTP operations
- Implement proper rate limiting mechanism (time.sleep or more sophisticated approaches)
- Use a combination of BFS/DFS approach for traversal depending on site structure
- Consider using a library like reppy for robots.txt parsing
- Handle common HTTP errors with appropriate retry mechanisms

## Tasks
1. Create web crawler module with configurable starting points
2. Implement robots.txt parsing and adherence
3. Add rate limiting functionality
4. Implement page discovery and URL collection
5. Create a URL filtering system based on include/exclude patterns
6. Add retry logic for transient errors
7. Develop visited URL tracking to avoid duplicates
8. Write unit tests for crawler functionality

## Definition of Done
- Crawler successfully traverses test websites and collects all URLs matching patterns
- Rate limiting is verified to work correctly
- Crawler respects robots.txt directives
- All unit tests pass
- Crawler gracefully handles common errors (connection issues, timeouts, etc.)
