# STORY-009-2: Content Validation Implementation

## Description
As a developer, I need to implement content validation to ensure accurate extraction of information from the MCP documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Content extraction accuracy validation (target: >98%)
- Validation of correct file naming and organization
- Basic content comparison between original and converted content
- Validation of content structure preservation
- Implementation of content validation metrics

## Technical Notes
- Use the simplified architecture components:
  - Content Processor for extraction validation
  - Storage Manager for file operations
  - Monitoring Handler for metrics
- Implement content comparison algorithms
- Create validation rules for content structure
- Set up metrics collection for content validation

## Tasks
1. Implement content extraction validation
2. Create file naming and organization validation
3. Develop content comparison tools
4. Set up content structure validation
5. Implement content validation metrics
6. Create basic validation report

## Definition of Done
- Content extraction validation is implemented
- File naming and organization validation is working
- Content comparison tools are functional
- Content structure validation is in place
- Basic validation metrics are being collected
- Initial validation report can be generated
