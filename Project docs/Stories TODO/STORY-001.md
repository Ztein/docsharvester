# STORY-001: Project Setup and Configuration Framework

## Description
As a developer, I need a properly configured development environment and a flexible configuration framework to enable easy customization of the scraper for different documentation sites.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Git repository is initialized
- Project structure is created according to the architecture plan
- Python environment is set up with UV package manager
- Basic dependencies are specified in pyproject.toml
- Configuration manager can load and validate YAML configurations
- Basic README is created with setup instructions
- .gitignore file is configured appropriately

## Technical Notes
- Use Python 3.9+ for compatibility
- Use PyYAML for configuration handling
- Implement validation for configuration to ensure all required fields are present
- Create a clear interface for the configuration manager that other components will use

## Tasks
1. Initialize git repository
2. Create project folder structure
3. Set up UV package manager and virtual environment
4. Create pyproject.toml with basic dependencies
5. Implement configuration manager module
6. Create example configuration files
7. Write unit tests for configuration manager
8. Create basic README with setup instructions

## Definition of Done
- All code passes linting and unit tests
- Configuration manager can successfully load, validate, and provide access to configuration values
- Project can be set up from scratch following the README instructions
