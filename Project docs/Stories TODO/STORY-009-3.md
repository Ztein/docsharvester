# STORY-009-3: Link Validation Implementation

## Description
As a developer, I need to implement link validation to ensure all documentation links are properly maintained and accessible.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Link integrity validation (target: 100%)
- Validation of internal documentation links
- Validation of external links
- Link validation metrics collection
- Basic link validation report generation

## Technical Notes
- Use the simplified architecture components:
  - Web Crawler for link discovery
  - Content Processor for link extraction
  - Monitoring Handler for metrics
- Implement link validation algorithms
- Create link validation rules
- Set up metrics collection for link validation

## Tasks
1. Implement internal link validation
2. Create external link validation
3. Develop link validation metrics
4. Set up link validation reporting
5. Create basic link validation report

## Definition of Done
- Internal link validation is implemented
- External link validation is working
- Link validation metrics are being collected
- Basic link validation report can be generated
- Link validation process is documented
