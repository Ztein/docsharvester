# STORY-011: Performance Optimization

## Description
As a user, I need the scraper to operate efficiently and handle large documentation sites without excessive resource usage or time.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Implements performance optimizations for CPU, memory, and network usage
- Adds optional parallel processing for faster execution
- Implements caching mechanisms to avoid redundant downloads
- Optimizes HTML parsing and Markdown conversion
- Maintains efficiency with large documentation sites
- Provides performance metrics and monitoring
- Allows for configuration of performance parameters

## Technical Notes
- Consider using asyncio for asynchronous operations
- Implement connection pooling for HTTP requests
- Use efficient data structures for tracking and processing
- Consider using LRU cache for frequently accessed data
- Balance between performance and respectful website crawling

## Tasks
1. Analyze performance bottlenecks in the current implementation
2. Implement HTTP connection pooling
3. Add optional parallel processing for independent operations
4. Create caching mechanisms for network and processing operations
5. Optimize memory usage for large sites
6. Implement performance metrics collection
7. Add performance-related configuration options
8. Conduct performance testing and benchmarking
9. Document performance characteristics and configuration

## Definition of Done
- Scraper processes large documentation sites efficiently
- Performance metrics show significant improvement over baseline
- Memory usage remains stable during long-running operations
- Caching reduces redundant operations
- Optional parallel processing improves throughput
- Performance characteristics are documented
- Configuration options allow for performance tuning
