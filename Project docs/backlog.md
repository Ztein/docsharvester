## Risks and Mitigations
- **Rate limiting and site policies**: Implement respectful crawling to avoid IP bans
- **HTML parsing complexities**: Use robust parsing libraries and implement site-specific extraction rules
- **Link transformation errors**: Comprehensive testing of internal link conversion
- **Performance issues with large documentation**: Implement caching and optional parallel processing
